_Homework_
* Problem Set 1: Due Thursday, 2/13/2014 (by the beginning of class)
* Create a short reproducible document (using knitr) that describes the basic structure of a dataset and summarizes some key features of the data using a few key tables and figures. Choose a dataset from [these datasets](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/Main/DataSets) or the ones in the class Google Drive. If your dataset has a lot of variables, focus on a subset of them -- less than 6 or so -- for the purposes of this exercise. Your write-up should answer the following questions:
  * What is the background/context for this data? 
  * How many observations are there?
  * What is the unit of observation?
  * Is there any missing data? If so, are there patterns to the missingness?
  * What are the key variables and what do their distributions look like?
  * Is there a pair of variables that might work well for a Simple Linear Regression? (You don't necessarily need to run one, but you could.)
  * Are there any obvious outliers in the data?
