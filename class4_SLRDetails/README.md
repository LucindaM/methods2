Class 4 : SLR continued: R^2, ANOVA, likelihood
-------
**Statistical Modeling and Data Visualization  (PUBHLTH 690NR)**   
**Taught by [Nicholas Reich](http://people.umass.edu/nick), UMass Biostatistics**


Class agenda
* wits and wagers CI exercise
* random presentations: BtheB dataset introductions
* mini-lecture: least squares and geometry of regression
* lab: Open the Mother/Daughter heights dataset. Use plot_ss() function to estimate some regression lines. Rather than using lm() to fit the data, calculate the betas and the resulting RSS ``by hand'' using R. How many lines of code did it take you? 
* lab: Formulate and fit a reasonable SLR model to BtheB dataset in small groups. Present regressions. Talk about different model formulations and results.

Homework
* Problem Set 1: Due Thursday, 2/13/2014 (by the beginning of class)
* Create a "slr()" R function that takes x and y vectors and outputs a list with: R's fitted lm() object and by-hand betas (calculated by likelihood or formulae).
