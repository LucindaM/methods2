Class 3 : Geometry of regression and least squares
-------
**Statistical Modeling and Data Visualization  (PUBHLTH 690NR)**   
**Taught by [Nicholas Reich](http://people.umass.edu/nick), UMass Biostatistics**


Class agenda
* random presentations: OpenIntro lab 7 "on your own" section
* mini-lecture: least squares and geometry of regression
* lab: Open the Mother/Daughter heights dataset. Use plot_ss() function to estimate some regression lines. Rather than using lm() to fit the data, calculate the betas and the resulting RSS ``by hand'' using R. How many lines of code did it take you? 

Homework
* Problem Set 1: Due Thursday, 2/13/2014 (by the beginning of class)
* Install the HSAUR2 package, read up on and explore the BtheB dataset (hint: ``?BtheB''). Be prepared to describe the dataset and answer questions about it in next class. Example questions: What kind of study is this? Is it a randomized clinical trial? How many datapoints are there? What was the central hypothesis of this study? What is the central outcome?...
