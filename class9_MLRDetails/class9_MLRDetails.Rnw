\begin{frame}{Recap: Least squares for MLR}

As in simple linear regression, we want to find the $\bbeta$ that minimizes the residual sum of squares.
$$RSS(\bbeta) = \sum_i \epsilon_i ^2 = \epsilon ^T \epsilon$$
\vskip2em

After taking the derivative, setting equal to zero, we obtain:
$$\hat \bbeta = (\bX^{T}\bX)^{-1}\bX \by$$


\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Hat matrix}

$$ \bH = \bX(\bX^{T}\bX)^{-1}\bX $$

Some properties of the hat matrix:
\bi
	\myitem It is a projection matrix: $\bH \bH = \bH$
	\myitem It is symmetric: $\bH^{T} = \bH$
	\myitem The residuals are $\hat{\epsilon} = (\bI - \bH) \by$
	\myitem The inner product of $(\bI - \bH) \by$ and $\bH \by$ is zero (predicted values and residuals are uncorrelated).
\ei

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[t]{Projection space interpretation}

The hat matrix projects $\by$ onto the column space of $\bX$. Alternatively, minimizing the $RSS(\bbeta)$ is equivalent to minimizing the Euclidean distance between $\by$ and the column space of $\bX$.

\begin{frame}{Key points so far}

\bi
        \myitem Our model is $\by = \bX \bbeta + \bepsilon$ with $\epsilon \sim (0, \sigma^2 \bI)$
	\myitem The design matrix $\bX$ contains the terms included in the model
	\myitem We've derived least squares solutions under some conditions
\ei

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Least squares estimates}

\bi
	\myitem $\hat{\bbeta} = \left( \bX^{T} \bX \right)^{-1} \bX^{T} \by$
	\myitem A condition on $\left( \bX^{T} \bX \right)$:
	\vspace{1cm}
	\myitem If $\left( \bX^{T} \bX \right)$ is singular, there are infinitely many least squares solutions, making $\hat{\bbeta}$ non-identifiable (can't choose between different solutions)
\ei

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Non-identifiability}

\bi
	\myitem Can happen if $\bX$ is not of full rank, i.e. the columns of $\bX$ are linearly dependent (for example, including weight in Kg and lb as predictors)
	\myitem Can happen if there are fewer data points than terms in $\bX$: $n < p$ (having 100 predictors and only 50 observations)
	\vspace{1cm}
	\myitem Generally, the $p \times p$ matrix $\left( \bX^{T} \bX \right)$ is invertible if and only if it has rank $p$.

\ei

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Infinite solutions}

Suppose I fit a model $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \epsilon_i$.
\bi
	\myitem I have estimates $\hat{\beta}_0 = 1, \hat{\beta}_1= 2$
	\myitem I put in a new variable $x_2 = x_1$
	\myitem My new model is $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + \epsilon_i$
	\myitem Possible least squares estimates that are equivalent to my first model:
	\bi
		\item $\hat{\beta}_0 = 1, \hat{\beta}_1= 2, \hat{\beta}_2 = 0$
		\item $\hat{\beta}_0 = 1, \hat{\beta}_1= 0, \hat{\beta}_2 = 2$
		\item $\hat{\beta}_0 = 1, \hat{\beta}_1= 1002, \hat{\beta}_2 = -1000$
		\item $\ldots$
	\ei

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Non-identifiablity}

\bi
	\myitem Often due to data coding errors (variable duplication, scale changes)
	\myitem Pretty easy to detect and resolve
	\myitem Can be addressed using {\it penalties} (might come up much later)
	\myitem A bigger problem is near-unidentifiability (collinearity)
\ei

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Causes of collinearity}

\bi
	\myitem Arises when variables are highly correlated, but not exact duplicates
	\myitem Commonly arises in data (perfect correlation is usually there by mistake)
	\myitem Might exist between several variables, i.e. a linear combination of several variables exists in the data
	\myitem A variety of tools exist (correlation analyses, multiple $R^2$, eigen decompositions)
\ei

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Effects of collinearity}

Suppose I fit a model $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \epsilon_i$.
\bi
	\myitem I have estimates $\hat{\beta}_0 = 1, \hat{\beta}_1= 2$
	\myitem I put in a new variable $x_2 = x_1 + error$, where $error$ is pretty small
	\myitem My new model is $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + \epsilon_i$
	\myitem Possible least squares estimates that are nearly equivalent to my first model:
	\bi
		\item $\hat{\beta}_0 = 1, \hat{\beta}_1= 2, \hat{\beta}_2 = 0$
		\item $\hat{\beta}_0 = 1, \hat{\beta}_1= 0, \hat{\beta}_2 = 2$
		\item $\hat{\beta}_0 = 1, \hat{\beta}_1= 1002, \hat{\beta}_2 = -1000$
		\item $\ldots$
	\ei
	\myitem A unique solution exists, but it is hard to find
\ei

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Effects of collinearity}

\bi
	\myitem Collinearity results in a ``flat" RSS
	\myitem Makes identifying a unique solution difficult
	\myitem Dramatically inflates the variance of LSEs
\ei

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Some take away messages}

\bi
        \myitem Collinearity can (and does) happen, so be careful
	\myitem Worst cases tend to be ``pathological examples", so don't lose hope
	\myitem Often contributes to the problem of variable selection, which we'll touch on later
\ei

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Categorical predictors}

\bi
	\myitem Assume $X$ is a categorical / nominal / factor variable with $k$ levels
	\myitem With only one categorical $X$, we have classic one-way ANOVA design
	\myitem Can't use a single predictor with levels $1, 2, \ldots, K$ -- this has the wrong interpretation
	\myitem Need to create {\it indicator} or {\it dummy} variables
\ei

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Indicator variables}

\bi
	\myitem Choose one group as the baseline
	\myitem Create 0/1 terms to include in the model $x_1, x_2, \ldots x_{k=1}$
	\myitem Pose the model 
	$$ y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \ldots + \beta_{k-1} x_{i, k-1} + \epsilon_{i}$$
	and estimate parameters using least squares
	\myitem Note distinction between {\it predictors} and {\it terms}
