#### Project Assignment
For the project you will create, in small groups, a thorough analysis of a particular dataset. The write-up will be accompanied by a set of lab exercises designed to illustrate a particular concept for a advanced undergraduate or graduate class such as this one. Each group will be expected to hand in (1) a PDF file that contains the data analysis write-up (ideally this would be typeset using LaTeX/knitr), and (2) an R Markdown file and associated HTML page for each lab exercise.

Choice of a strong dataset will be particularly important. Each group should consider multiple datasets as possibilities and will need to have their final choice approved by the instructor.

#### Data analysis write-up
The data analysis will provide a brief and information-rich description and summary of key features of the dataset. This should be written as if for publication in a journal. Additionally, each member of the group will lead a particular thread of analysis that includes one of the following techniques:
* regression trees
* natural or B-splines
* non-linear regression
* mixed/random effects models
* resampling inference 
* ... or any other slightly more advanced regression-oriented topic (please feel free to choose something that you are interested in learning more about, but not something that you have already done) 
The data analysis write-up will contain a section for each group member's analysis and a conclusion that summarizes the results. 

#### Lab exercises
The lab exercises should mirror in structure some of the exercises that we have done in class (e.g. Global F-tests, permutation tests). Short, clear examples. Things that make the exercises interactive at the small-group or whole-class level (e.g. comparing p-values) are a plus.

#### GitHub
It is expected that each group will craft their analysis collaboratively on GitHub.
