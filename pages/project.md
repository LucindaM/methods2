#### Project Assignment
For the project you will create, in small groups, a thorough analysis of a particular dataset. The write-up will be accompanied by a set of lab exercises designed to illustrate a particular concept for a advanced undergraduate or graduate class such as this one. Each group will be expected to hand in (1) a PDF file that contains the data analysis write-up (ideally this would be typeset using LaTeX/knitr), and (2) an R Markdown file and associated HTML page for each lab exercise.

Choice of a strong dataset will be particularly important. Each group should consider multiple datasets as possibilities and will need to have their final choice approved by the instructor.

#### Data analysis write-up
The data analysis will provide a brief and information-rich description and summary of key features of the dataset. This should be written as if for publication in a journal. Additionally, each member of the group will lead a particular thread of analysis and/or dataset exploration that expands on a topic that we have covered in class. 

For this independent data analysis portion of the project, the two major paths that you can take are 
1. to fit a specialized model to the data (i.e. not just MLR with vanilla covariates) and interpret the output from the methods that you have used. Examples here include regression trees, incorporating natural splines into an MLR model, or a mixed-effects model.
2. to fit a more standard model (or set of models) to the data but compare different ways of analyzing or interpreting the model fit. For example, you could do a very detailed model diagnosis or model selection by comparing different model diagnostic or selection metrics.

Examples of topics (for either of the categories above...)
* regression trees
* natural or B-splines
* non-linear regression
* mixed/random effects models
* resampling inference 
* a simulation study based on the data
* a comparison and exploration of model-selection criteria, e.g. PRESS, Mallow's Cp, AIC, BIC, adjusted R^2 
* a comparison and exploration of a model-diagnostic criteria, e.g. leverage, influence, Cook's Distance
* ... or any other slightly more advanced regression-oriented topic (please feel free to choose something that you are interested in learning more about, but not something that you have already done) 

The data analysis write-up will contain a section for each group member's analysis and a conclusion that summarizes the results. 

#### Lab exercises
The lab exercises should mirror in structure some of the exercises that we have done in class (e.g. Global F-tests, permutation tests). Short, clear examples. Things that make the exercises interactive at the small-group or whole-class level (e.g. comparing p-values) are a plus.

#### GitHub
It is expected that each group will craft their analysis collaboratively on GitHub. 

#### Project grading
Your project grade makes up 35% of your final grade for the class and will be calculated as follows:
* The final product produced by the group 50%
* Individually prepared data analysis 25%
* Individually prepared lab exercise 25%

To evaluate group participation and contributions, I will be using the following approach to evaluate each of your contributions to the project. Each student will be given 100 points to allocate among your teammates (excluding yourself). The more points you give to a teammate, the more you are indicating they contributed to the project. You cannot allocate the same number of points for any two team members. I reserve the right to intervene to correct gross imbalances in allocations if necessary. The number of points that you receive from your teammates will be summed, divided by 100, and then used as a multiplier on the final grade for the group project. 

As an example: Your group receives 40/50 points for the "final product produced by the group". You have three teammates who give you scores of 35, 40 and 30, respectively. Therefore, you receive a total of 105 points from your teammates. So your final "group" grade is (40/50) * (105/100) = 0.84 = 42/50.
